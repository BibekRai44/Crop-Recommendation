# Crop Recommendation System

A simple app that suggest you to harvest suitable crop according to your soil chemical properties.

This app provides farmers Optimal resource utilization,increased in crop yield and decision suppor on which crop to plant. 

## How this project is done ?
I have collected publicly available crop chemical properties data present in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset). Using this data, I developed different ML models([here](https://github.com/BibekRai44/Harvest-Nepal/blob/main/Project/crop%20recomendation.ipynb)) to predict best possible result.Among them , I have used ML model which have highest accuracy.
Using this model,I created app from [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) where user can provide input their soil chemical values and get best suitable crop to harvest.

## What tech stack is used here?
 1) Python 
 2) Streamlit(open source python library) for creating app
 2) Python libraries like pandas,numpy for data cleaning and performing mathematical operation
 3) Python libraries like matplotlib,seaborn for visualizing Data
 4) Python libraries like scikit-learn to perform ML operation

## I will integrate new features in this in upcoming days.
